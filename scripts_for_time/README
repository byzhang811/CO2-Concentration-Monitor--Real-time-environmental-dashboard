This folder contains the files used to synchronize time on the EC535 BeagleBone running a stripped-down Buildroot system.
Because the image does not include NTP, SNTP, systemd-timesyncd, or HTTPS support, the BeagleBone cannot sync time from the Internet.
Instead, it reads the current time from a local HTTP server running on Windows.



start_time_server.ps1
PowerShell script that:
Updates time.txt every second with the current Windows time
Starts a Python HTTP server on port 8000
Serves time.txt at:http://192.168.137.1:8000/time.txt

time.txt
Text file automatically updated with the current time in the format:YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

How to Use

Run these two lines:
chmod -x .\start_time_server.ps1
.\start_time_server.ps1

fix_net_and_sync_time.sh which:

Sets the system clock using date -s
Updates RTC with hwclock -w
